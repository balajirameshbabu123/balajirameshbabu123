Iâ€™m a Data Analyst & Engineer with 6+ years of experience turning raw data into actionable insights. My background spans cloud data engineering, statistical analysis, and business intelligence, with a strong focus on building scalable solutions that drive decision-making.

Iâ€™ve worked across industries designing AWS-based data pipelines, developing advanced DAX and Power BI dashboards, and delivering predictive insights using Python, SQL, and R. My projects range from improving financial forecasting with real-time dashboards to analyzing 200K+ Zillow housing records for investment opportunities.

What drives me is the impactâ€”whether itâ€™s streamlining ETL workflows that cut processing time by 40%, building dashboards that guide leadership strategy, or uncovering patterns that shape organizational policy.

Core Strengths:
â€¢ Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI, Tableau, Excel)
â€¢ Cloud Data Engineering (AWS Glue, Lambda, Redshift)
â€¢ Advanced DAX, SQL Optimization, ETL Automation
â€¢ Machine Learning & Statistical Analysis (Python, R, Pandas, Numpy)
